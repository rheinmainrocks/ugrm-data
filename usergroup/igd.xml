    <name>Independent Game Developers Rhein-Main</name>
    <description>This group is for everyone in the Rhein-Main area who is interested in game development and would like
        to exchange with other developers and game designers. The goal is to meet once a month, get to know each other
        and talk about various topics, e.g. frameworks and tools, marketing your game, monetization or just the love for
        game development.
